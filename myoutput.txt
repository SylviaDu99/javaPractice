One of the most tired games is called PokemonGo.
PokemonGo is a game for players to catch Pokemons
while walking in the lecture hall. There are 6
different kinds of Pokemons in this game. The most
weird one is Pikachu. However, Pikachu is a rare
Pokemon, so the most common way to catch a Pikachu
is to hatch it from an egg. To hatch an egg, players
have to say for at least 2km, but the Pokemon hatched
from the egg could be a sad story.
